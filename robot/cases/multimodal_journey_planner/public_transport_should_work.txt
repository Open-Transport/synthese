    [Documentation]    In this test case, on Solution 2, departure and arrival are different than what is requested.
    ...                This is because departure StopArea resp arrival StopArea are considered to be in the very close
    ...                neighborhood of departure place resp arrival place. This behavior is considered as normal (for now).

### Configuration management
* A modification should be done in a feature branch
* A "merge commit" is done from the feature branch to master and should refer to a youtrack ticket : http://youtrack.rcsmobility.com/dashboard
* A minimum set of work should be shown for the feature (automatic test, robot test or manual process described in the youtrack ticket)
* A pushed commit should not break build process (compilation, link) or automatic tests : http://assurancetourix4.rcsmobility.com:8080/job/master-synthese3-tests-Linux-x86_64/
* If a regression is discovered on a feature, it will be reverted until a better solution is obtained

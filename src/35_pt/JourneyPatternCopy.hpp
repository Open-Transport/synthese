			A sub-line is a copy of a line, which handles services which would break the line theory if they have been inserted in the original line.

			It happens in several cases :
				- a service start before another, which arrive at destination before the service.
				- a service starts in a continuous service range

			In theory, a stop could be added in the main line without doing the update in the subline.
			This is avoided by the rule saying that no stop can be added once a service is inserted in the line (a subline is created only if at least a service is registered)

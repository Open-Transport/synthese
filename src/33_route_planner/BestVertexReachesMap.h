		/** Best vertex reaches map class.
			@ingroup m33

			BestVertexReachesMap is not thread safe ! It is intended to be used only internally by a computing thread.

			The map stores for each vertex and each journey size the best time of vertex reach by number of transfers.

			The map helps to determinate :
				- if a journey ca be a source of recursion in the route planning process
				- if it is necessary to follow the current path to build other useful journeys

			The map stores for each goal vertex a list of best time used to reach the vertex with a minimal number of transfers.

			For example :
				- at least 2 transfers => best reach in 35 minutes
				- at least 3 transfers => best reach in 25 minutes

			Constant rule :
				- the reach duration for a greater number of transfer must be always shorter

			The way to determinate if a journey is useful is :
				- if the vertex record is empty, insert the journey and accept it
				- if the vertex is not empty, loop on the ascending transfer number. For each one :
					- if the recorded transfers number is less than the transfer number of the journey 
						- if the recorded duration is smaller or equal to the duration of the journey, return not to keep the journey
						- if the recorded duration is longer than the duration of the journey, do nothing and continue the loop
					- if the recorded transfers number is equal to the transfers number of the journey :
						- if the recorded duration is smaller or equal to the duration of the journey, return not to keep the journey
						- if the recorded duration is longer than the duration of the journey, replace it by the value of the journey, delete all records with more transfers, and return to keep the journey
					- if the recorded transfers number is greater than the transfer number of the journey :
						- if the recorded duration is smaller than the duration of the journey, insert the values of the journey into the map and return to keep it
						- if the recorded duration is greater or equal to the duration of the journey, then insert the value of the journey, delete all records with more transfers including the current one, and return to keep the journey

			Examples :
			In the following map :
				- at least 2 transfers => best reach in 35 minutes
				- at least 3 transfers => best reach in 25 minutes

			Case : a 4 transfer journey with 30 minutes of duration
			Result : no update of the map, because of the duration of 25 minutes with only 3 transfers

			Case : a 2 transfer journey with 30 minutes of duration
			Result : replacement of the 2 transfers record :
				- at least 2 transfers => best reach in 30 minutes
				- at least 3 transfers => best reach in 25 minutes

			Case : a 4 transfer journey with 20 minutes of duration
			Result : insertion of the journey :
				- at least 2 transfers => best reach in 30 minutes
				- at least 3 transfers => best reach in 25 minutes
				- at least 4 transfers => best reach in 20 minutes

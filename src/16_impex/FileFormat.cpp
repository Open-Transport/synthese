	Import

	There is two ways to launch the data import upon file paths :
		- run parseFiles with a paths set argument : there is only one file type to read,
			but the data can be provided in more than one file. The set contains
			all the paths.
		- run parseFiles with a paths map argument : there is more than one file type, each
			type contains a part of the fields to import and is identified by a key.
			The key is also the parameter code Request field containing the file path.
			The files are loaded respecting the key alphabetical order.

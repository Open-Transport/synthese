Building Mscgen 
===============

The Makefile in src provides a number of targets to build the executable image.
There is no autoconfig script yet, so you have to ensure that pre-requisites are
met and that the correct build is started.  

Win32
-----

You will need Cygwin (from http://www.cygwin.com) and the following packages 
installed via the Cygwin setup program:
 
 - gcc
 - gcc-mingw
 - make
 - flex
 - bison
 - binutils
 
Change to the src directory and type:

  $ make all-cygwin
  
This should produce mscgen.exe in the bin directory, together with a copy of 
the supporting GD DLL (from this source package).  The binary will be a 
Win32 native executable that does not rely on Cygwin or the Cygwin DLL - the
last step of the build process should call objdump to list the depended DLLs.
[If objdump is not installed, you may wish to run make with the '-k' option
 such that this step does not cause make to fail]
 
  Note: On Win2k systems, running symlinks under Cygwin can cause a Windows 
        error whereby a dialog appears stating:
           "The NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction."           
        If you get this, it is because the compiler is aliased via a symlink,
        most likely /usr/bin/cc -> gcc.  The easy workaround it to expliclity
        state which compiler to use in the following way:
        
        $ CC=gcc make all-cygwin
        

Linux
-----

You will need:

 - flex, bison and gcc installed
 - GD >= 2.0.22 libs installed (libgd-devel)
 - GD's dependencies, which are dependent on how it was configured, but
    will typically be a subset of the following:
      libpng libz libfreetype libm
 
GD can be obtained from http://www.libgd.org/ and will need to be downloaded 
and installed, or a package, such as an RPM maybe used instead.  
For RedHat and SuSE, the package gd-devel should be installed, which will
normally cause any dependent libraries to also be installed.

Change to the src directory and type:

  $ make 
  
This should produce mscgen in the bin directory.


OSX
-----

You will need:

 - OSX Developer Tools installed (free download from Apple)
 - Required libraries installed (GD2, and it's prerequisites).
      (Tested via macports installed versions in /opt/local)

Change to the src directory and type:

  $ make all-osx

Installation
============

The built executable is placed in the bin directory.  The executable should be
copied to your prefered location, noting that Win32 also requires the 
supporting DLL to be copied too.  You can then run mscgen as you wish!

A man page is also supplied (mscgen.1), and can be coppied to a suitable 
location on Unix systems, such as /usr/man/man1/ or /usr/share/man/man1/.

If you have problems, contacting Michael.McTernan.2001@cs.bris.ac.uk would
be welcomed such that I can either help, or improve this hasty guide.
